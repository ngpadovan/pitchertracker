Getting Started: Log In to start tracking your pitchers. this could be done on the home page by clicking log in or on the "My Pitchers" page by clicking "Add Pitcher". Select "Add Pitcher" to navigate to the add pitcher form where you submit your pitcher's information. That pitcher is now displayed on the "My Pitchers" page with a "DETAILS" button. Click the details button to see the pitchers show page with more details and also a form to submit a gamelog. Fill out and submit the gamelog form to track the pitchers game history. In order to update or delete a pitcher selcet "UPDATE/DELETE PITCHER" at the top of the pitchers details/show page. Fill out and submit the update form to make a change or select the delete pitcher button above the form to delete the pitcher an associated gamelogs from the database.

Next Steps: I would love to add a schedule that shows you when your pitcher has a game or is planned to start. There are more attributes that can be added to the pitchers along with statistics. ALso maybe an index page where users can see other users favorites and comment.
